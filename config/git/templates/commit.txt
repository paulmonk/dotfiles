# --- COMMIT END ---
# --------------------
# Remember
# - Use the imperative mood in the subject line ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
#   This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands
#   like git merge and git revert.
#
# - Do not end the subject line with a period.
#   It is a heading/title and those don't end with a period.
#
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line.
#   In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
#   subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.
#   The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical
#   (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused
#   if you run the two together.
#
# - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   Reviewers and your future self can read the patch, but might not understand
#   why a particular solution was implemented.
#
# - Use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
#   Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
#   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here.
