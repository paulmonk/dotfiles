# vim: ft=cfg

# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.
# ===================================================================

# ===================================================================
# == Options
# ===================================================================
# Show hidden files? You can toggle this by typing 'zh'
set show_hidden true

# Use non-default path for file preview script?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README.md for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.
set preview_script /usr/share/doc/ranger/config/scope.sh

# Use the external preview script or display simple plain text or image previews?
set use_preview_script true

# Be aware of version control systems and display information.
set vcs_aware true

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images true

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * w3m (default):
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
#   This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
#   It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
#   This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
#   width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
#   iterm2_font_width and iterm2_font_height to the desired values.
#
# * terminology:
#   Previews images in full color in the terminology terminal emulator.
#   Supports a wide variety of formats, even vector graphics like svg.
#
# * urxvt:
#   Preview images in full color using urxvt image backgrounds. This
#   requires using urxvt compiled with pixbuf support.
#
# * urxvt-full:
#   The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the
#   whole terminal window.
#
# * kitty:
#   Preview images in full color using kitty image protocol.
#   Requires python PIL or pillow library.
#   If ranger does not share the local filesystem with kitty
#   the transfer method is changed to encode the whole image;
#   while slower, this allows remote previews,
#   for example during an ssh session.
#   Tmux is unsupported.
set preview_images_method w3m

# Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
# default, jungle, snow, solarized
set colorscheme solarized

# Enable the mouse support?
set mouse_enabled false

# Set a title for the window?
set update_title true

# Try to keep so much space between the top/bottom border when scrolling:
set scroll_offset 3

# Turning this on makes sense for screen readers:
set show_cursor false

# One of: size, natural, basename, atime, ctime, mtime, type, random
set sort natural

# Additional sorting options
set sort_reverse false
set sort_case_insensitive true
set sort_directories_first true
set sort_unicode false

# Disable displaying line numbers in main column
set line_numbers false

# Examples:
# setlocal path=~/downloads sort mtime
